# Summary of Work

This document summarizes the work done on the AurenLM project.

## Mind Map Feature Implementation

- **Backend (`python_backend/app.py`)**:
    - Implemented a `/generate-mindmap` endpoint to generate a mind map from a document.
    - The endpoint uses the local LLM to generate a hierarchical mind map structure in JSON format.
    - Improved error handling and logging to debug issues with the LLM response and CORS.

- **Frontend (`src/components/Studio.js`, `src/App.js`)**:
    - Integrated the `reactflow` library to visualize the mind map.
    - Added a "Generate Mind Map" button to the `Studio` component.
    - The frontend now calls the `/generate-mindmap` endpoint and renders the mind map from the JSON response.

## IP Address Management

- Changed the hardcoded IP address in `python_backend/app.py` to a new one as requested.
- Reverted the IP address change back to the original one.

## Code Debugging

- Investigated and resolved a 500 Internal Server Error that was occurring during mind map generation. The issue was traced to the LLM not returning a valid JSON response.
- The prompt was improved, and the LLM temperature was adjusted to get a more reliable JSON output.
- Investigated and resolved a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error by updating the Flask-CORS configuration in the backend.

## Project Exploration

- Examined the contents of the new `AurenLM` folder and provided a summary of its structure.
- Identified that the `AurenLM` project uses the `emergentintegrations` library to connect to OpenAI's `gpt-5` model.
