# Session Summary: Today's Work

This document summarizes the key changes and features implemented during our session today.

## 1. Local LLM Integration Update
- The local LLM endpoint in `python_backend/app.py` was updated to `http://100.102.173.88:8080/completion`.

## 2. Frontend Bug Fixes
- Resolved the "Objects are not valid as a React child" error in `src/components/Chat.js` by correcting how event handlers were passed to buttons.

## 3. Document Workflow Refinement
- **Backend (`python_backend/app.py`):**
    - The `get_local_llm_summary` function was initially updated to return a structured JSON object containing a summary, key concepts, and suggested questions.
    - Later, it was simplified to return only a single-paragraph summary string, as per user request.
    - The `/upload` endpoint was adjusted to correctly handle the structured/simplified responses from `get_local_llm_summary`.
- **Frontend (`src/App.js`, `src/components/DocumentList.js`):**
    - Refactored `App.js` to manage the `files` state and upload logic, passing necessary props to `DocumentList`.
    - `DocumentList.js` was updated to be a presentational component, displaying document names and making them clickable to initiate chat sessions.
    - Summaries are now automatically displayed in the chat panel upon document upload.

## 4. Layout Enhancements
- Implemented a three-panel layout (Sources, Chat, Studio) in `src/App.js` using Material-UI `Grid`.
- Added functionality for collapsible side panels (`DocumentList` and `Studio`) with toggle buttons, allowing the central chat panel to expand.
- Adjusted the layout to ensure containers fill the entire webpage width without external gaps.

## 5. Chat Experience Improvements
- **Chatbot Persona:** Changed the chatbot's identity from "remmacs" to "AurenLM" in `src/components/Chat.js` (system prompt and conversation formatting) and in `python_backend/app.py` (stop tokens).
- **Response Length:** Increased the `n_predict` parameter in `python_backend/app.py` (`comp` function) to 512 to prevent chat responses from being cut off.
- **Conversation Memory:** Implemented a conversation summarization strategy:
    - A new `/summarize_conversation` endpoint was added to `python_backend/app.py`.
    - `src/components/Chat.js` now checks the conversation length and, if it exceeds a `MAX_CONVERSATION_LENGTH`, sends the older parts of the conversation to the backend for summarization. The summary then replaces the older history, improving memory management for long chats.
