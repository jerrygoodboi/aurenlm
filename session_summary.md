# Session Summary: AurenLM Development

This document summarizes the changes made during our last development session, the current state of the AurenLM application, and the immediate next steps to resolve a persistent error.

## Summary of Changes Made:

1.  **Project Renaming:**
    *   The project name was changed from `notebooklm-clone` to `aurenlm` across:
        *   Root `package.json` (`"name": "aurenlm"`)
        *   `backend/package.json` (`"name": "aurenlm-backend"`)
        *   `public/index.html` (`<title>AurenLM</title>`)
        *   `src/App.js` (AppBar display name: `AurenLM`)

2.  **Gemini API Integration (Node.js Backend - `backend/index.js`):**
    *   Initially, `backend/index.js` was modified to update the Gemini API key, change the model to `gemini-2.0-flash`, and simplify the summarization prompt. The response format was changed to a simple JSON with a `summary` key.
    *   The `/completion` endpoint in `backend/index.js` was updated to accept `pdfContent` and include it in the prompt sent to Gemini.
    *   **Note:** This Node.js backend is currently *not* used for LLM interactions in the `text-completion-testing` branch.

3.  **Python Backend for Local LLM (New `python_backend` directory):**
    *   A new Python backend was created in the `python_backend` directory.
    *   `config.py`: Stores `GEMINI_API_KEY` (not used in this branch) and `GEMINI_API_URL`.
    *   `requirements.txt`: Lists `Flask`, `requests`, `pdfplumber`, `Flask-Cors`.
    *   `app.py`:
        *   Handles file uploads (`/upload`) for PDF/text processing.
        *   Extracts text from PDFs using `pdfplumber`.
        *   Includes a `filter_notes_section` function to remove specified "notes" content.
        *   Contains `send_post_request` and `comp` functions for interacting with a *local LLM server* at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/completion`.
        *   A `get_local_llm_summary` function was added to use the local LLM for PDF summarization, returning results as a list of strings (with robust parsing for various list formats). This replaced the initial Gemini call for summarization.
        *   A `/local_completion` endpoint was added for chat interactions with the local LLM. The `comp` function was made stateless, and `pdfContent` is now correctly incorporated into the prompt for the local LLM.
        *   Debugging print statements were added to `local_completion` to inspect the type and value of `response_content` before `jsonify`.

4.  **Frontend (`src` directory):**
    *   **`src/components/DocumentList.js`:**
        *   Modified to point `handleUpload` to the Python backend's `/upload` endpoint (`http://localhost:5000/upload`).
        *   Refactored to display PDF main points as an interactive list, instead of an alert. Each list item is clickable.
        *   The `files` state now stores `fullText` along with `file` and `summary`.
        *   Fixed a React warning by explicitly setting the `button` prop to `button={true}`.
    *   **`src/App.js`:**
        *   Manages `chatContext` state (`{ fullText: string, initialPrompt: string }`).
        *   Passes `handleMainPointClick` to `DocumentList`.
        *   Renders the `Chat` component conditionally, passing `initialPrompt` and `pdfContent` from `chatContext`.
        *   The `initialPrompt` generation was modified to *not* include the full PDF content in the text sent to the chat display, while still passing `fullText` separately to the backend as `pdfContent`.
    *   **`src/components/Chat.js`:**
        *   Accepts `initialPrompt` and `pdfContent` as props.
        *   Uses a `useEffect` hook to initialize the chat and automatically send the initial prompt based on the clicked PDF main point.
        *   `handleSend` was modified to correctly construct conversation context, handling both initial and subsequent prompts, and passing `pdfContent` to the backend.
        *   The chat completion endpoint was switched from `http://localhost:3001/completion` (Node.js backend) to `http://localhost:5000/local_completion` (Python backend) to use the local LLM for chat.
        *   ESLint warnings were addressed: `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` (fixed with `useCallback`) and `no-useless-concat` (fixed with template literal).
        *   Fixed `TypeError: promptToSend.trim is not a function` by ensuring `promptToSend` is a string.
        *   Fixed `400 Bad Request` from Python backend caused by empty prompt for initial chat.

## Current State of the Application:

*   **Front-end:** Configured to interact with the Python backend for both PDF summarization and chat. Sends `pdfContent` and `initialPrompt` to the Python backend. Displays summaries as clickable list items and launches chat sessions.
*   **Python Backend:** Handles file uploads, extracts PDF text, summarizes with a local LLM, and provides a chat completion endpoint (`/local_completion`) using the same local LLM. It's designed to be stateless for chat context, processing `pdfContent` and constructing the full prompt for the local LLM.
*   **Node.js Backend:** Is no longer actively used for LLM interactions in this `text-completion-testing` branch. It can be turned off.
*   **Local LLM (External):** An external local LLM server is required to be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/completion` to serve both summarization and chat requests from the Python backend.

## Remaining Issue & Next Steps:

*   **Persistent Error:** `Objects are not valid as a React child` error still occurs when typing "hello" and clicking send in the chat. This indicates that `response.data.content` in the frontend is *still* an object, despite the string conversion logic added in the `comp` function in `python_backend/app.py`.
*   **Debugging:** Debugging print statements were added to `python_backend/app.py` in the `local_completion` function to inspect the type and value of `response_content` just before it's sent to `jsonify`.

**What to do next:**

1.  **Run Application:** Start all necessary components (Local LLM server, Python Backend, Frontend) as per the instructions below.
2.  **Trigger Error:** In the frontend, type "hello" in the chat input box and click "Send".
3.  **Analyze Python Backend Logs:** Check the terminal where the Python backend is running for the output of:
    *   `Type of response_content from comp:`
    *   `Value of response_content from comp:`
    Please share this output.
4.  **Identify LLM Response Format:** Based on the analysis of the Python backend logs, we will determine if the local LLM is returning content in an unexpected format (e.g., a nested JSON object, or a list that `jsonify` is handling unexpectedly).
5.  **Implement Correct Handling:** We will then implement the correct handling in the Python backend to ensure that a plain string (or a stringified JSON if the LLM insists on returning structured data) is always returned for chat responses, resolving the React rendering error.

## Instructions to Run the Application:

**1. Start the Local LLM Server:**
   - Ensure you have a local LLM server running at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` that can handle completion requests. This is crucial for the new summarization and chat to work.

**2. Start the Python Backend (for PDF processing and chat completion):**
   - Open a new terminal.
   - Navigate to the `python_backend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd python_backend
     ```
   - Run the setup script:
     ```bash
     ./run.sh
     ```
   - This will install dependencies and start the Flask server on `http://localhost:5000`. Keep this terminal open.

**3. Start the Frontend:**
   - Open another new terminal.
   - Navigate to the project root directory (where `package.json` is located):
     ```bash
     cd /home/jerry/auremlm/aurenlm
     ```
   - Install frontend dependencies (if you haven't already):
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the React development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - This will open the frontend application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Note:** The Node.js backend is no longer used for any LLM interaction in this setup. You can choose not to run it if you are only using the local LLM.
